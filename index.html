        <h2>QUALITY</h2>
        <p>
            In urban areas or cities, there is no such like a calm and tension free life. All we see is people in a hurry to reach their offices and doing their work.  The working style in the cities is also very different.
            People do not do any physical jobs, they work mostly on their personal computers and have different machines attached to these computers depending upon the field of work.          
            For example, for science and technology, all the analysis and calculation are done by different instruments. These instruments are attached to the computers which directly shows the result.

        <p>
            Urbanization refers to the movement of the population from rural areas to urban areas.
            It is essentially the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas.
            Furthermore, urbanization is quite a popular trend in the contemporary world.
            Moreover, people mostly undertake urbanization due to more work opportunities and a better standard of living.
            According to the expert prediction, by 2050, 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized.</p>

        <h2>URBANIZATION</h2>
        <p>First of all, political causes play a big role in urbanization. Many people get forced to leave rural areas 
            for urban areas due to political unrest. Therefore, many families go to urban areas in search of food, shelter, and employment.
            Another important cause of urbanization is an economic cause. Furthermore, poverty is a widespread phenomenon 
            in rural areas. Moreover, farmers are finding it very hard to earn enough money and make a living.
